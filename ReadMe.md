# QAQFCourseGenerator (QCG)

This course generator uses Ollama local installation to complete its generative tasks.  
To install Ollama and run it locally, use the instructions available here:  
[https://github.com/ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)

To run Ollama with LLAMA3, run this command:
Ollama run llama3



QCG is in initial development. Work on its 4th step is in progress. This is for sharing with our team for integration evaluation purposes.

Surely, there will be lots of issues and inconsistencies. They are deliberately left till the time once the complete flow is complete.

The QCG is being built using Django 5.1.1 with Python 3.12.

The REST framework is enabled.
